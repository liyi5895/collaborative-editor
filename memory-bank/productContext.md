# Product Context

## Purpose
The Collaborative Editor is designed to provide a real-time document editing platform that allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously. It integrates AI assistance to enhance the writing and editing process, making document collaboration more efficient and productive.

## Problems Solved
1. **Fragmented Collaboration**: Traditional document editing often involves sending files back and forth, leading to version control issues and inefficient workflows. This platform enables real-time collaboration.
2. **Limited Writing Assistance**: Writers often need help with improving their content but may not have access to human editors. The AI assistant provides immediate feedback and suggestions.
3. **Context Switching**: Moving between document editing and communication tools disrupts workflow. The integrated chat interface allows users to communicate without leaving the editing environment.
4. **Manual Document Management**: Managing document versions and tracking changes can be cumbersome. The platform handles this automatically.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Seamless Collaboration**: Users should be able to edit documents together with minimal latency and conflicts.
2. **Intuitive Interface**: The platform should be easy to use with a clean, modern UI that doesn't require extensive training.
3. **Helpful AI Assistance**: AI suggestions should be relevant, helpful, and easy to implement or dismiss.
4. **Responsive Design**: The application should work well across different devices and screen sizes.
5. **Minimal Friction**: Document creation, editing, and sharing should require minimal steps.

## Target Users
1. **Content Creators and Writers**: Professionals who need assistance with writing and editing.
2. **Teams**: Groups working on shared documents who need real-time collaboration.
