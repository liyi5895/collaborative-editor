# Project Progress

## What Works

### Frontend
- ✅ **Document Editor**: Basic rich text editing with Slate.js
  - Text formatting (bold, italic, underline, code)
  - Headings (H1, H2, H3)
  - Lists (bulleted and numbered)
  - Document serialization/deserialization
- ✅ **Chat Panel**: Interface for communicating with the AI assistant
  - Message display with user/AI distinction
  - Message input and submission
  - Chat history display
- ✅ **Document Management**: Basic document management functionality
  - Document creation with title
  - Document selection from list
  - Auto-saving of document changes
- ✅ **API Integration**: Communication with the backend
  - Document CRUD operations
  - Chat message sending and receiving
  - React Query for data fetching and caching

### Backend
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for document and chat operations
  - Document creation, retrieval, and updating
  - Document version history
  - Chat history retrieval
  - Chat message processing
- ✅ **AI Integration**: Basic AI assistant functionality
  - Document analysis for suggestions
  - Chat message processing
  - LangChain and LangGraph integration
- ✅ **Data Storage**: In-memory storage for documents and chat history
  - Document storage with versioning
  - Chat history storage by document

## What's Left to Build

### Frontend
- ❌ **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket integration for real-time updates
  - Cursor positions of other users
  - Real-time document changes
  - Conflict resolution
- ❌ **User Authentication**: User login and registration
  - User profiles
  - Document ownership and sharing
- ❌ **Advanced Editor Features**: Additional editing capabilities
  - Images and media embedding
  - Tables
  - Comments and annotations
  - More formatting options
- ❌ **UI Enhancements**: Improved user experience
  - Responsive design for mobile
  - Dark mode
  - Accessibility improvements
  - Loading states and error handling

### Backend
- ❌ **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication
  - Document change broadcasting
  - User presence notifications
- ❌ **Authentication System**: User management
  - User registration and login
  - JWT authentication
  - Permission management
- ❌ **Database Integration**: Persistent storage
  - PostgreSQL integration
  - Data migration from in-memory storage
- ❌ **Advanced AI Features**: Enhanced AI capabilities
  - More sophisticated document analysis
  - Context-aware suggestions
  - Learning from user feedback

## Current Status

The project is in the **early development stage** with the following components implemented:

1. **Core Frontend Components**: The main UI components are in place, including the document editor, chat panel, and document list.
2. **Basic Backend API**: The backend API is functional with endpoints for document and chat operations.
3. **AI Integration**: Basic AI assistant functionality is implemented with mock responses.

The application can currently:
- Create and edit documents with rich text formatting
- Save documents to the backend (in-memory storage)
- Chat with the AI assistant
- Receive basic AI suggestions for document improvements

## Known Issues

1. **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in memory and is lost when the server restarts
2. **AI Limitations**: The AI assistant currently uses mock responses instead of a real language model
3. **No Real-time Updates**: Changes made by one user are not immediately visible to others
4. **No Authentication**: There is no user authentication or authorization system
5. **Limited Error Handling**: Error handling is minimal and could be improved
6. **Performance Concerns**: Large documents may cause performance issues
7. **No Offline Support**: The application requires a constant connection to the backend

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions
- Chose React with TypeScript for the frontend for type safety and component-based architecture
- Selected Slate.js for the rich text editor due to its flexibility
- Decided on FastAPI for the backend for its performance and ease of use
- Opted for in-memory storage initially for simplicity

### Revised Decisions
- Added React Query for data fetching and caching to improve state management
- Implemented document versioning to track changes
- Structured the AI assistant with LangGraph for better workflow management
- Designed the API with future database integration in mind

### Future Considerations
- May need to implement Operational Transformation or CRDT for conflict-free real-time collaboration
- Considering WebSocket vs. Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Evaluating different database options (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for persistent storage
- Exploring options for more advanced AI integration with fine-tuned models
