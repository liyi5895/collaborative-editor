  - Suggestion highlighting and application
- ✅ **Chat Panel**: Interface for communicating with the AI assistant
  - Message display with user/AI distinction
  - Message input and submission
  - Chat history display
  - Model selection dropdown for choosing different LLM models
  - Robust error handling for different response formats
  - Markdown code block parsing for JSON responses
- ✅ **Document Management**: Basic document management functionality
  - Document creation with title
  - Document selection from list
  - Auto-saving of document changes
- ✅ **API Integration**: Communication with the backend
  - Document CRUD operations
  - Chat message sending and receiving
  - React Query for data fetching and caching

### Backend
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for document and chat operations
  - Document creation, retrieval, and updating
  - Document version history
  - Chat history retrieval
  - Chat message processing
- ✅ **AI Integration**: Advanced AI assistant functionality
  - Document analysis for suggestions
  - Chat message processing
  - LangChain and LangGraph integration
  - Real LLM integration via OpenRouter API
  - Support for multiple LLM models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o Mini)
  - Enhanced response handling for markdown-formatted JSON
  - Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ **Data Storage**: In-memory storage for documents and chat history
  - Document storage with versioning
  - Chat history storage by document

## What's Left to Build

### Frontend
- ❌ **Code Refactoring**: Further improvements to code organization
  - Extract more components from large files

  - Improve TypeScript type definitions
- ❌ **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket integration for real-time updates
  - Cursor positions of other users
  - Real-time document changes
  - Conflict resolution
- ❌ **User Authentication**: User login and registration
  - User profiles
  - Document ownership and sharing
- ❌ **Advanced Editor Features**: Additional editing capabilities
  - Images and media embedding
  - Tables
  - Comments and annotations
  - More formatting options
- ❌ **UI Enhancements**: Improved user experience
  - Responsive design for mobile
  - Dark mode
  - Accessibility improvements
  - Loading states and error handling

### Backend
- ❌ **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication
  - Document change broadcasting
  - User presence notifications
- ❌ **Authentication System**: User management
  - User registration and login
  - JWT authentication
  - Permission management
- ❌ **Database Integration**: Persistent storage
  - PostgreSQL integration
  - Data migration from in-memory storage
- ❌ **Advanced AI Features**: Enhanced AI capabilities
  - More sophisticated document analysis
  - Context-aware suggestions
  - Learning from user feedback

## Current Status

The project is in the **development stage** with the following components implemented:

1. **Core Frontend Components**: The main UI components are in place, including the document editor, chat panel with model selection, and document list.
2. **Modular Architecture**: The document editor has been refactored into a modular architecture with smaller components and custom hooks.
3. **Basic Backend API**: The backend API is functional with endpoints for document and chat operations.
4. **AI Integration**: Advanced AI assistant functionality is implemented with real LLM integration via OpenRouter API.

The application can currently:
- Create and edit documents with rich text formatting
- Save documents to the backend (in-memory storage)
- Chat with the AI assistant using different LLM models
- Receive AI-generated suggestions for document improvements
- Apply AI suggestions to the document

## Known Issues

1. **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in memory and is lost when the server restarts
2. **API Key Management**: OpenRouter API key needs to be manually configured in the .env file
3. **No Real-time Updates**: Changes made by one user are not immediately visible to others
4. **No Authentication**: There is no user authentication or authorization system
5. **Limited Error Handling**: Error handling has been improved but could be further enhanced
6. **Performance Concerns**: Large documents may cause performance issues
7. **No Offline Support**: The application requires a constant connection to the backend
8. **LLM Rate Limits**: Potential rate limiting issues with the OpenRouter API
9. **Markdown Formatting**: Some LLM responses may contain markdown formatting that needs to be parsed

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions
- Chose React with TypeScript for the frontend for type safety and component-based architecture
- Selected Slate.js for the rich text editor due to its flexibility
- Decided on FastAPI for the backend for its performance and ease of use
- Opted for in-memory storage initially for simplicity

### Revised Decisions
- Added React Query for data fetching and caching to improve state management
- Implemented document versioning to track changes
- Structured the AI assistant with LangGraph for better workflow management
- Integrated real LLM models via OpenRouter API
- Added model selection capability to the chat interface
- Designed the API with future database integration in mind

### Recent Decisions
- Refactored the DocumentEditor component into smaller, more maintainable pieces
- Created custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic
- Enhanced error handling for different response formats
- Added support for markdown-formatted JSON responses
- Implemented proper state updates after editor transformations

### Future Considerations
- May need to implement Operational Transformation or CRDT for conflict-free real-time collaboration
- Considering WebSocket vs. Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Evaluating different database options (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for persistent storage
- Exploring additional LLM models to add to the selection dropdown
- Considering caching mechanisms for LLM responses to improve performance and reduce API costs
